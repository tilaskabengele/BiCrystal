# BiCrystal
``BiCrystal`` is a **Python 3** program that builds incommensurate crystal structures of layered materials. The current version reads CIF files and writes the new structure to a QUANTUM ESPRESSO input file. The program also provides additional information such as the bond distance between atoms, lattice vectors in Bohr and Angstrom, and a simple 3D plot of each layer.

# Overview
Building unit cells of arbitrary size is often an inevitable task when studying the physical and mechanical properties of layered materials such as graphene, hexagonal Boron Nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides. Although most visualzation software such as Xcrysden, VESTA or Avogadro provide very powerful tools for analysing and manipulating periodic crystal structures, constructing large unit cells in bilayers with one of the layers perturbed can be very daunting. ``BiCrystal`` provides a convinient and easy way of creating new crystal structures of arbitrary size from CIF files.

# Download and Installation
The latest version of ``BiCrystal`` can be found on github:

# Packages
We recommend running BiCrystal in python 3.8.x, where it has been thoroughly tested. Aditionally, we recommend installing BiCrystal and all its dependencies via poetry using the .lock and .toml files provided. These files contain all the dependencies of BiCrsytal with the appropriate versions used. You can learn more about poetry from the official website: https://python-poetry.org/. For more information on crystals and shapely, visit: https://pypi.org/project/crystals/ and https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/ respectively.

After you have installed poetry on your machine, cd into the source folder of the cloned repository and run 

     poetry install
     
This will create a virtual environment for BiCrystal. To activate the virtual environment and use BiCrystal, run
     
     poetry shell

# Usage
BiCrystal is an interactive program that instructs the user every step of the way. To start BiCrystal, in the terminal type:

    bicrystal
    
The first thing you will be required to do is input your cif file, e.g. graphite.cif:

    ***Input cif file***
    graphite.cif

Next, input scaling parameters m and n, which correspond to the scale of the lattice vectors along the x and y directions, respectively. As an example, let's take m = 2, n = 1. Bicrystal caculates the relative rotation angle for the given m and n. In this case, the rotation angle will be 21.79 degrees.
    
    ***Rotation parameters***
    Enter m 2
    Enter n 1

After that, you will be required to pick a zeroeth atom from the top and bottom layer. If we were picking the atoms by hand using a visualization software such as Xcrysden, this would be the atom we start from when creating the new cell vectors. 

    Intializing atoms...


    Initial TOP atoms..
    Atom No. 1   c   [0.  0.  0.5]
    Atom No. 2   c   [0.66667 0.33334 0.505  ]

    Initial BOTTOM atoms..
    Atom No. 3   c   [0. 0. 0.]
    Atom No. 4   c   [0.33333 0.66667 0.005  ]
    
 For a good symmetrical structure, always pick atoms such that the zeroeth TOP and BOTTOM atoms align. In this example, that would be Atom No. 1 and Atom No. 3. After picking your zeroeth atoms, a window with a simple 3D will then open.
 
    Select zeroeth TOP atom
    Enter Atom No. 1

    Select zeroeth BOTTOM atom
    Enter Atom No. 3

 Finally, you can save your output as a QUANTUM ESPRESSO file and visualize with Xcrysden for a more sophisticated look.
 
     ********************* SUMMARY REPORT ***********************
    
    Rotation angle (deg) =  19.107
    Relative Rotation (deg) =  21.787
    
    Top atoms(rotated) =  14
    Bottom atoms  =  14

    Total atoms
    = 28

    *************************** Done! **************************

    Would you like to write Espresso file?[Y/n]

# Examples
Let's say we saved our output in the example given above as graphite28.scf.in, we can visualize this with Xcrysden.
   
       xcrysden --pwi graphite28.scf.in

Looking from the top view, we can see that for this rotation, a Moire pattern was created. Really neat! This was not apparent from the simple 3D plot because BiCrystal plots cartesian coordinates of the atoms where the top and bottom layer do not necessarily align. Before writing the QUANTUM ESPRESSO file, `BiCrystal` removes symmetrically equivalent atoms and maps back those atoms that fell outside the unit cell due to rotation. 

The **examples/** folder has over 30 examples of Moire patterns graphite, Molebdenum Disulfide and blue Phosphorene generated from `bicrystal`. Below are some examples.

# Graphite 364-atom unit cell
